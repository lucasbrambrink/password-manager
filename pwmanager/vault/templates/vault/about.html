        <h3>Design Tenents</h3>
        <h4>Security by design</h4>
        <p>
            It is impossible to lose, use, or abuse data one doesnâ€™t possess.
            Therefore one designs systems to reduce the amount of sensitive user data
            stored or possible to be acquired.
        </p>

        <h4>Encryption works</h4>
        <p>
            When designing a system, one prefers security that is
            enforced by cryptography instead of enforced by software or personnel
            policy.
        </p>

        <h4>Comprehension & Transparency</h4>
        <p>
            One strives to fully understand all available and implemented tools.
            Commanding their strengths and weaknesses will maximize
            the ability to choose the correct tool for a particular task.
