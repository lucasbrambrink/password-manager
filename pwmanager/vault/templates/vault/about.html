    <section class="introduction">
        <p>This platform was designed to simply & securely store login credentials.
            By better managing the multitude of passwords we use for
            online services, we can increase our security and better maintain our privacy.
        </p>

        <p>This platform leverages the latest encryption techniques to deliver full end-to-end encryption.
            Moreover, users can apply extra security features (e.g. MFA, AWS keys) to establish their level
            of desired security. By providing a user-friendly interface and high availability,
            it aims to tidy up our online security measures.

        <h3>Syste, Design Tenets</h3>
        <h4>Security by design</h4>
        <p>
            It is impossible to lose, use, or abuse data one doesn’t possess.
            Therefore one designs systems to reduce the amount of sensitive user data
            stored or possible to be acquired.
        </p>

        <h4>Encryption works</h4>
        <p>
            When designing a system, one prefers security that is
            enforced by cryptography instead of enforced by software or personnel
            policy.
        </p>

        <h4>Comprehension & Transparency</h4>
        <p>
            One strives to fully understand all available and implemented tools.
            Commanding their strengths and weaknesses will maximize
            the ability to choose the correct tool for a particular task.
        </p>

        <h4>Audit & Testing</h4>
        <p>
            Through a suite of security tests, load tests and other tools, one can
            discover and eliminate vulnerabilities. Maintaining full test coverage
            ensures security during the development process.
